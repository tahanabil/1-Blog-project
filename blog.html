              <b>Pharaoh’s Island</b> is the name of an islet located north of
              the Gulf of Aqaba, on the eastern coast of the Sinai Peninsula,
              Egypt. it called The picturesque <b>Pharaoh’s Island</b> because
              it was first occupied during the reign of Ramses III, was also
              called “Coral Island”. It is located in the Red Sea, in the
              northwest corner of the Gulf of Aqaba, 11 km south of Eilat, near
              the eastern coast of the Sinai Peninsula. Very small in size
              (approximately 300 m long and 100 m wide), it is formed by two
              large rocks that protrude some twenty meters above sea level,
              interconnected by a third rock, which is smaller than the previous
              two. Surrounded by fabulous reefs, <b>Pharaoh’s Island</b> (known
              as Coral Island by Israelis) is very popular with divers. The
              island is just 250 m (820 ft) from the shore, close to the border
              with Israel, and boats leave from the Salah ad-Din Hotel on the
              coastal road opposite the island. Worth exploring is the restored
              ruins of a 12th-century Crusader castle, strategically placed to
              ensure the safety of pilgrims to the Holy Land. The castle was
              captured by Salah ad-Din in 1170 and used as an Arab stronghold
              against the Crusaders until 1183 when it was eventually abandoned.

              Far East and Europe, because it is located on a high ground,
              During the period of the Crusaders, this fortress was used to
              collect taxes from Arab merchants to attack Arab ships, as well as
              to protect pilgrims traveling between Jerusalem and the monastery
              of St. Catherine.

            <h3>The <b>Pharaoh’s Island</b> today</h3>
            <p>
              The tourist interest of the island itself is very limited,
              compared to the many archaeological sites of cultural attraction
              that Egypt offers as a whole. However, its immediate surroundings
              are attractive, especially for lovers of diving and observation of
              aquatic fauna, including the Picasso crossbow fish, or coral
              reefs. Because around the island, you can see remains of
              foundations from the Hellenistic and Byzantine periods show that
              the <b>Pharaoh’s Island</b> was a very frequented route. The other
              advantage of this tour is the possibility of diving or snorkeling
              away from the crowds in transparent waters.

              Or just swimming and relaxing. ” An example was given by one
              Thomas Edward Lawrence, later known as Lawrence of Arabia During
              an intelligence mission on the Sinai Peninsula in 1914, he asked
              for permission to visit the island and its ruins. After having
              built a makeshift raft to the island, with his Bedouin guide
              recounting this episode, “Lawrence seems to have been fascinated
              by the adventure of the episode as well as by the evocative ruins
              of the island itself.

            <h3>Restoration work on the <b>Pharaoh’s Island</b></h3>
            <p>
              The trying of the Egyptian tourism authorities to promote to
              <b>Pharaoh’s Island</b>, However, the ruins in question lead us to
              a story of a rich past evoked in very broad strokes. This is what
              the Egyptian tourism authorities are trying to promote, through
              the restoration work recently carried out on the Citadel, as well
              as a proposal submitted to UNESCO, for its inscription on the
              World Heritage List. Compared to the Citadel of Cairo, this
              island, although adorned with the aura also of Salah el-Din is
              “minuscule”. But this “tourist pearl in Sinai,” and “architectural
              jewel.

            The
              Tourism and Antiquities Ministry has begun renovating the western
              part of the <b>Saint Catherine Monastery’s</b> Library alongside
              restoring the monastery’s church buildings, the Director-General
              of Research, Archaeological Studies and Academic publication in
              South Sinai Abdel Rahim Rihan announced Saturday. The library
              ranks second next to the Vatican Library in terms of historically
              important manuscripts, according to Rihan, as it 4,500
              manuscripts. The ministry has already renovated the monastery’s
              Saint Stephen and Saint John churches, with plans in place to
              establish an automatic extinguishing and fire warning system.
              Rihan added that restoration work for the library’s eastern
              segment has already been finalized, with the manuscripts having
              been re-indexed and the library halls reorganized, with means of
              protection provided for the manuscripts as well.
              The renovation work does not include the al-Wadi al-Moqads (Sacred
              Valley) site or the natural reserve, Rihan said. He assured that
              the monastery will never construct in these areas in order to
              maintain their sanctity. The Tourism Ministry will install a
              lighting system, remove electrical poles starting from the
              monastery’s chain door to its entrance, and establish a security
              gate to check bags and individuals alongside a security control
              room and surveillance cameras. The ministry is also preserving
              natural landscapes such as the Moses Mountain, the Monastery
              Garden, six historical wells and the Springs of Moses.

            Catherine
              of Alexandria was a Christian martyr sentenced to death on the
              breaking wheel. When this failed to kill her, she was beheaded.
              According to tradition, angels took her remains to Mount Sinai.
              Around 800 AD, monks found her remains and built the monastery.
