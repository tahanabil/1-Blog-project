          <h2>Abu Simbel</h2>
          <p>
            Even in a country festooned with temples, Abu Simbel is something
            special. This is Ramses II's great temple, adorned with colossal
            statuary standing guard outside, and with an interior sumptuously
            decorated with wall paintings.<a href="/Post/index.html">more...</a>

          <h2>Pyramids of Giza</h2>
          <p>
            The last surviving wonder of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World,
            the Pyramids of Giza are one of the world's most recognizable
            landmarks. Having awed travelers down through the ages, these tombs
            of the Pharaohs Cheops (Khufu), Chephren (Khafre), and Mycerinus
            (Menkaure), guarded by the enigmatic Sphinx, are usually top of most
            visitor's lists of tourist attractions to see in Egypt and often the
            first sight they head to after landing.<a href="/Post/index.html"

          <h2>Luxor's Temples & Tombs</h2>
          <p>
            Famed for the Valley of the Kings, Karnak Temple, and the Memorial
            Temple of Hatshepsut, the Nile-side town of Luxor in Upper Egypt has
            a glut of tourist attractions. This is ancient Thebes, power base of
            the New Kingdom pharaohs, and home to more sights than most can see
            on one visit.<a href="/Post/index.html">more...</a>

          <h2>Diving the Red Sea</h2>
          <p>
            Below the Red Sea's surface is another world as fascinating as the
            temples and tombs on land. The coral reefs of the Red Sea are
            renowned among scuba divers for both the soft corals on display and
            the vast amount of sea life, ranging from colorful reef fish and
            nudibranchs, to sharks, dolphins, turtles, rays, and even dugongs.<a

          <h2>Islamic Cairo</h2>
          <p>
            The atmospheric, narrow lanes of the capital's Islamic Cairo
            district are crammed full of mosques, madrassas (Islamic schools of
            learning), and monuments dating from the Fatimid through to the
            Mameluke eras. This is where you'll find the labyrinth shopping souq
            of Khan el-Khalili, where coppersmiths and artisans still have their
            tiny workshops, and stalls are laden with ceramics, textiles, spice,
            and perfume.<a href="/Post/index.html">more...</a>

          <h2>South Sinai</h2>
          <p>
            Egypt's South Sinai region, on the Sinai Peninsula, offers a beach
            for every type of traveler. Sharm el-Sheikh is a European-style
            resort town packed full of luxury hotels, international restaurants,
            and bags of entertainment options. A favorite with Europeans on
            winter-sun vacations, many of the resorts here cater to families on
            one- or two-week sun-and-sand breaks.<a href="/Post/index.html"
